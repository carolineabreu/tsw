Welcome to our project, created as part of the second project of IronHack's Web Development Bootcamp SÃ£o Paulo - Remote!

Our goal with this project was to create a website that helps women travel safely and confidently. We understand that women often face unique challenges when traveling alone, from cultural and religious beliefs to health and security concerns.

The website features the GeoSure ranking, which explains the safety of a particular country, and reasons why a country may be deemed unsafe. Additionally, it also includes comments from other women who have traveled to a specific country, providing real-life perspectives and experiences.

The website is built using ReactJS, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the libraries Axios, ant design, material UI, and grommet. 
We hope that this website serves as a valuable resource for women planning their next trip.
